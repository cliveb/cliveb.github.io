I'm an engineer consulting on products and community management for nextgen MRP/ERP apps solving B2B / B2C from demand to delivery (really familiar catering to business developers).

Concurrently (since 2012) I enjoy contributing to camlistore.org helping build the community also team up to organize both the Seattle GDG (Google Developers Group) and Seattle Scalability distributed systems meetups.

Early work with MAX, Kewill and Exact helped lay the groundwork for inventiveness in product development and community management. Contributions to hundreds of thousands of online SMBs (some large SMEs).  

Always learning, always an adventure!
