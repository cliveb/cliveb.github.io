I'm a multi-skilled former senior principal research engineer consulting on nextgen app productivity for ERP transformations to cloud based B2B and B2C (really familiar catering from demand to delivery).

Concurrently (since 2011) Iâ€™m helping build nextgen app community and team up to organize both Seattle GDG and Seattle Scalability (distributed systems) meetups, contribute to camlistore.org community, plus discovery research and some startups.

Early work with Kewill at Intel and HP helped lay the groundwork for inventiveness in application design and at Exact for world scale R&D, work with the Google community for developer advocacy. 

Always learning, always an adventure!
