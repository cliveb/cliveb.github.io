I'm a senior engineer consulting on products and community management building nextgen ERP apps systems solving B2B / B2C from demand to delivery (really familiar catering to business developers). 

Concurrently (since 2012) I enjoy contributing to camlistore.org building the community and also team up to organize both the Seattle GDG (Google Developers Group) and Seattle Scalability distributed systems meetups. 

Always learning, always an adventure!
