I'm a multi-skilled former senior principal research engineer consulting on nextgen app productivity for ERP CRM transformations to cloud based B2B B2C (really familiar catering from demand to delivery for business developers).

Early work with Kewill at Intel and HP helped lay the groundwork for inventiveness in application design and at Exact for world scale SaaS, work with the Google community for developer advocacy.

Concurrently (since 2012) I’m helping build nextgen app community and team up to organize both Seattle GDG and Seattle Scalability (distributed systems) meetups, contribute to camlistore.org community, plus discovery research and startups.
