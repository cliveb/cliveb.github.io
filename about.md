Very experienced senior architect consulting on design and development of multi-layer applications for direct demand commerce and supply chain fulfillment (really familiar with big data landscape and catering to business developers). Also enjoy teaming up to organize both the Seattle GDG (Google Developers Group) and Seattle Scalability distributed systems meetups.
