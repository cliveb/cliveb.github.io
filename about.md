I'm an engineer consulting on products, community management and devrel for nextgen MRP/ERP apps solving B2B / B2C from demand to delivery (really familiar catering to business developers).

Concurrently (since 2012) I enjoy contributing to camlistore.org helping build the community also team up to organize both the Seattle GDG (Google Developers Group) and Seattle Scalability (distributed systems) meetups.

Early work with MAX, Kewill and Exact helped lay the groundwork for inventiveness in product development, community management and developer relations.    

Always learning, always an adventure!
