I'm an engineer consulting on products and community building nextgen apps systems for ERP solving B2B B2C from demand to delivery (really familiar catering to business developers). Also enjoy teaming up to organize both the Seattle GDG (Google Developers Group) and Seattle Scalability distributed systems meetups. Always learning, always an adventure!
