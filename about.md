Following 20+ years in software companies, Clive Boulton moved to startups specialising in consumerizing ERP. He has been working with the developer community ever since.

Concurrently (since 2012) Iâ€™m helping build nextgen app community and team up to organize both Seattle GDG and Seattle Scalability (distributed systems) meetups, contribute to camlistore.org community, plus discovery research and startups.

Always learning, always an adventure!
